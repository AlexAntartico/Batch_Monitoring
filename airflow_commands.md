# Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform that helps you manage and automate data pipelines. It's particularly useful for tasks like:  

**ETL**: Moving data between different systems.   

**Machine learning model training**: Automating the steps involved in training and deploying models.

**Data analysis and reporting**: Scheduling regular reports and analyses.   

## How does it work?

Aiflow uses a concept called Datapipeline as Code. You write your workflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using Python. This DAG defines the tasks, their order, and their dependencies.  

Airflow's scheduler takes care of running your tasks at the right time, while the web interface lets you monitor their progress, view logs, and troubleshoot any issues.

## Key Concepts

**DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: These represent your workflows visually, showing the tasks and their dependencies.  
**Operators**: These are the building blocks of your tasks. They perform specific actions, like running a Python script, executing a SQL query, or sending an email.  
**Tasks**: These are instances of operators within a DAG. They represent a single unit of work.  
**Scheduler**:This component monitors and triggers your tasks according to the defined schedule.  
**Webserver**: This provides a user-friendly interface to monitor and manage your workflows.

## Basic Commands

Most commands start with the `airflow` keyword.

**Command Structure**: The general structure is `airflow <category> <action> <options>`.

**Help**: Use `airflow -h` or `airflow <command> -h` to get help and see available options for any command.

**Configuration**: Airflow's behavior is controlled by the `airflow.cfg` file. You can modify this file to customize settings.
